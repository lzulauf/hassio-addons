# Luke's Home Assistant Addons Repository

This repository hosts home assistant addons that I've written for various use cases, and currently includes:
- [Icecast](icecast) - An internet radio host
- [Mumble Server](mumble-server) - A voice chat server

## Channels

There are two channels available for the repository: main and dev. I recommend that people use main, as dev is expected to break regularly.

The channels can be added as repositories in Home Assistant via the following urls:

### Main
